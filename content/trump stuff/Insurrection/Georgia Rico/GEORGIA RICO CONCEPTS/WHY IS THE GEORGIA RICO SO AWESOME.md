#### What delineates between the Federal RICO Act and Georgia's RICO Act. 

- Georgia has a nonstandard[ list of crimes](https://dlg.galileo.usg.edu/ggpd/docs/1980/ga/l407/1980/v_p1.con/1.pdf) (Page 431) that can be committed to qualify for a RICO, notably 
  
	- *(8) Code Section 26-1701, relating to forgery in the first*
	*degree*
	
	- *(13) Code Section 26-2301, relating to bribery.*
	
	- *(14) Code Section 26-2313, relating to influencing witnesses.*
	
	- *(15) Code Chapter 26-24, relating to perjury and other falsifications.*
	
	- *(16) Code Section 26-2501, relating to tampering with evidence.*
	- Asking Elected Officials to break oath
	- 


- Furthermore, the definitions for an enterprise is much broader than the Federal RICO Act
	 *‘Enterprise’ means any sole proprietorship, partnership, corporation, business trust, union chartered under the laws of this state,*
	*or other legal entity, or any unchartered union, association, or*
	***group of individuals associated in fact although not a legal entity,***
	***and it includes illicit as well as licit enterprises and governmental as***
	***well as other entities.***

- It is also important to note how much interpretation can be had with what Georgia calls "Prohibited Activity"

	*It is unlawful for any person, through a pattern of racketeering activity or proceeds derived therefrom, to acquire or maintain, directly or indirectly, any interest in or control of any enterprise, real property, or personal property of any nature including money.*
