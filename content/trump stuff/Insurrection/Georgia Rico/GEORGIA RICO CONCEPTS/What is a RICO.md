#### What is a RICO? 


- Racketeer Influenced and Corrupt Organizations Act 

-  What is racketeering? 
	Engaging in a pattern of illegal scheming and activity to commit a crime. 
	
	 A common misconception is that a RICO case must involve money, due to the Supreme Court case shown below. This is the case for States that do not refer to the Federal Statute. I believe there are 17 states that fall under this category. 
	 
	 **This is how Trump (and Young Thug) are able to be prosecuted in [[WHY IS THE GEORGIA RICO SO AWESOME|Georgia]], as at least for Trump, his crimes did not involve Financial Gain (afaik).** 
	 
	 [ Scheidler v. National Organization for Women, Inc. ](https://supreme.justia.com/cases/federal/us/547/9/)
		*The District Court dismissed the suit, holding that the voluntary contributions are not proceeds of racketeering and that a "racketeering enterprise" must have an economic motive, a fact that NOW could not demonstrate. The Court of Appeals affirmed and the Supreme Court granted certiorari.* 


- To be found guilty of a RICO case, the prosecutors must find (without reasonable doubt) 
	1. That an enterprise existed. 
	2. That the enterprise affected interstate commerce. (?)
	3. That the defendant was associated with or employed by the enterprise 
	4. The engaged in a pattern of racketeering activity. 
	5. This conduct happened at least twice within the scope of the alleged enterprise.
