### What was [[eastman.memo (1).pdf#page=1&selection=2,10,2,18|Eastman's Plan]]? 


- Eastman believed that VP could solely resolve the disputed electoral votes, and Congress would be powerless. 

- He also believed the Electoral Count Act to be unconstitutional, as it asks the two houses to act separately, whereas the 12th Amendment provides **only** for a joint session. 

- Furthermore, Eastman states that the Electoral Count Act states that any slate of electors verified by VP are the officials **Regardless of evidence regarding the election, and regardless of whether there was ever fair review of what happened in the election, by judges and/or state legislatures.**

Eastman's plan was simple. He was to have Pence start alphabetically, get to Arizona, then say that there are not any electors that can be deemed validly appointed in those states. 

Due to those seven states being **Democrat States**, not counting them would give Trump the presidency. 

Democrats would not appreciate this, and say that 270 electoral college votes are required. 

This would then turn it over to the house, and because the House had a 26-24 majority leaning Republican, they would vote on party lines, and **Trump would have won the election, and they have successfully committed a coup.**

### Why did Pence say no? 

When Pence got the Eastman Memos, he asked 



### Was there any legal ground for this? 

No. The theory was based on an article written by Bruce Ackerman that (VP at the time) Thomas Jefferson counted 1800 electoral college votes that he should not have, and by that mark, that gives ANY VP Cart Blanche to choose what votes to count. 

This has since been debunked
