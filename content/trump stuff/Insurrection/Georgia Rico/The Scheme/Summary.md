(*Note that during all of this, Trump's DOJ told him that there was no evidence of voter fraud*)


### Concepts to Understand

- [[Electors]]

- [[Electoral Count Act]]


#### PRE Dec 14

- Nov. 8, 2020: KJC steps into the foray, emailing a Trump Attorney an idea, where voter fraud claims would be purported, and in his words "a cloud of confusion" would be created, and no votes from WI could be counted, and the election could be thrown to the house. 

- Later, Mark Meadows steps in along with KJC, 

- On December 3, 2020, a hearing was held where Giuliani and John Eastman perjured themselves to Georgia Senate committee on the Judiciary, stating that there was fraud in their electoral Process. 

- On December 7, Trump called Georgia House Speaker David Ralston to hold a special session, asking for his own electors to be had. 

- Trump also called Brad Raffensperger, asking him to "find 11,780 votes", which would have reversed his loss in the state by a single vote margin.

- While they are cooking up this plan to have institute their own electors, The White House Counsel's office tells Meadows and Giuliani that the alternate elector's plan is not legally sound. 

- On Dec 13, 2020, Trump Campaign election operations director in Georgia tells the electors: "Your duties are imperative to ensure the end result — a win in Georgia for President Trump — but will be hampered unless we have complete secrecy and discretion", and "**Please, at no point should you mention anything to do with Presidential Electors or speak to the media"**

- Electors also asked for a promise that the Trump campaign would pay their legal feels if they were sued or charged for a crime, and the Michigan electors considered sleeping overnight in the State Capitol.

### DEC 14

- In AZ, GA, MI, NV, WI, the documents declare the signatories are "the duly elected and qualified Electors"

- IN NM and PA, they include clauses stating that their validity as electors are to be later determined. 
***
### Post DEC 14

- Eastman says that because state legislators did not validate the false electors, the false elector votes would be DOA in Congress on Jan 6th. 

- Eastman then says to a campaign staffer that even though his slates weren't authorized by state legislators, having "multiple slates of electors demonstrate the uncertainty of either". 

- Jenna Lynn Ellis sends a memo to Trump, echoing sentiments expressed in the Eastman memos, stating "Pence should not accept votes in which six states currently have electoral delegates in dispute." 

- Eastman Calls Rusty Bowers, Republican speaker of AZ House, asking that the state legislature "de-certify" the Joe Biden electors, but Rusty refuses. Eastman then says "Just do it and let the court sort it out."

- The Trump Campaign pushes harder for Pence to get the documents from the electors in his hands, but he already has said that he does not see them as having any legal basis, as they were not certified in their states. The plan failed here. 

- Jenna Lynn Ellis, on the day before Jan 6, says that Pence should read the documents alphabetically, see the AZ slate, and stop because "they know the electors have not been properly ascertained. " They knew the electors were BULLSHIT and thought about USING THAT FACT to GET PENCE TO STOP HIS COUNT

Since, Chesebro has plead guilty to a count of conspiracy to commit perjury.

### What did they want Mike Pence to do? 

A few different scenarios could have played out 
##### Scenario 1
1. Pence, seeing the disputes of electors in the 7 states they sent, throws them all away, and declares Trump as victor because he has more Electoral College votes. 
2. They predict Dems not liking this and saying that 270 Electoral College votes are required. 
3. They then kick it back to the House, and as they held majority at the time, they would have all certified it and... committed a coup.  
	*Why is this a coup?*
	- They knew the electorates were fake, and in fact, were banking on their ambiguous nature to be the reason that Pence throws both electorate slates away. 
##### Scenario 2
1. 
## In short...

The Trump campaign, spearheaded by Kenneth Chesebro and John Eastman, created a and successfully executed a plan for false electoral slates to be sent, and for that to cause enough confusion for Mike Pence to deny certifying them, kicking the vote to the House, and letting the Republican majority house certify Trump as the president.
