### The Beginning, planting seeds. 
- **Giuliani** calls Officials in Georgia claiming Voter Fraud
- **Jenna Lynn Ellis**, **Giuliani**, and **Sidney Powell** go to RNC and make claims of Voter Fraud
- **Mark Meadows**, **DJT**, and **Giuliani** meet with high ranking Michigan officials and make claims of voter fraud to them 
- **DJT** calls **Rusty Bowers**, speaker of the Arizona House of Representatives, and asks him to elect his own electors to cast votes for **DJT**.
- **Giuliani** and **Jenna Ellis** gave false statements to Pennsylvania legislators, where both of them, and later **DJT** on the phone, asked Pennsylvania legislators to appoint their own electors. 
- Later during that day, **DJT**, **Mark Meadows**, **Giuliani**, **Jenna Ellis**, asked Pennsylvania legislators at the White House to hold a special session of the Pennsylvania General Assembly. 
- **Giuliani** calls **President Pro Tempore of the PA State Senate Jake Corman** and asks him to appoint their own false electors 
- **Giuliani** and **Jenna Lynn Ellis** then contact PA senate officials for the next few days, urging them to appoint their own false electors. 
- **Giuliani** and **Jenna Ellis** then appear in Arizona, discussing the same false claims of voter fraud to Arizona Legislators, and asked them to appoint their own electors. **DJT** later joined the meeting over telephone and urged the same. 
- **Michael Roman** began coordinating the contact of State legislators in Georgia and elsewhere, asking them to appoint their own electors. 
- (*JAN 6)* **DJT** and **Mark Meadows** meet with **John McEntee**, asking **McEntee** to propose a plan stopping the join session *Jan 6*. Part of this plan was having **Pence** only count electoral votes from certain states, and return the remaining votes to state legislatures. (LOOK MORE INTO THIS!!! WHERE THE STATES TO BE RETURNED THE STATES THAT HAD DJT ELECTORS???)*

*"SOLICITATION OF VIOLATION OF OATH BY PUBLIC OFFICER, in Violation of O.C.G.A. §§ 16-47 & 16-10-1", which entails their direct ask of multiple Georgia senators to unlawfully appoint electors in Georgia, knowing they did not have the right to do so."*

Furthermore, the claims they made to do this where found to be untrue in the eyes of the law, making the statements that they put down perjurious, as a result, 
- ***Giuliani** committed the felony offense of 

*" FALSE STATEMENTS AND WRITINGS, in violation of O.C.G.A. § 16-10-20, in-Fulton County, Georgia, by knowingly, willfully, and unlawfully making at least one of the following false statements and representations to members of the Georgia Senate present at a Senate Judiciary Subcommittee meeting"*

### TRUMP BABYRAGES OVER PA OFFICIALS 

-  **Trump and Giuliani** repeatedly call PA Congressman with voter fraud claims, begging them to hold a Special Session, where they would attempt to institute their own electors. They specifically asked Georgia Governor Brian Kemp more than once to call a Special Session. 
	*A special session is a meeting where extremely important matters are discussed. In PA, GA, and AZ, (I believe) they can only be called upon by state governors.*

- After their refusal to hold the session, **DJT** tweets
	*"Gee, what a surprise. Has anyone informed the so-called (says he has no power to do anything!) Governor @BrianKempGA & his puppet Lt. Governor @GeoffDuncanGA, that they could easily solve this mess, & WIN. Signature verification & call a Special Session. So easy!"*

### Sidney Powell Gets Creative (I don't care about any of this)

- Sidney Powell starts working with "SullivanStricker LLC", a forensic data firm in GA, with the goal of collecting data and analytics from Dominion Voting Equipment in Michigan and elsewhere. 

- On Dec 18th, **DJT**, **Giuliani, and Sidney Powell** all meet up to discuss strategies for how to influence the election, such as seizing voting equipment and appointing **Sidney Powell** as special council, with the ability to investigate allegations

- On Dec 21, **Sidney Powell** requested a copy of all Data SullivanStricker LLC found from the Dominion Voting Machines.

### Robert Cheeley and John Eastman Enter The Foray

- Robert Cheeley enters the Foray, emailing Eastman stating that he was attempting to get a meeting with powerful Georgian legislators, stating that he would "make the leadership aware of the importance of Trump electors to meet on Dec 14.". He also asked Eastman for a citation tot the requirements of the duties which they must comply with. 

*(Note: Must research more about Robert Cheeley and how he got involved. His name does not come up until pretty late in the indictment, on page 28. )*

- John Eastman sent an email to Robert David Cheeley (Georgian Lawyer) and Georgia Senator Brandon Beach that Trump's electors needed to meet On Dec 14, 2020, sign their six certificates of vote, and mail them to "The President of the Senate and other officials."

- Robert Cheeley then sent ANOTHER email stating that he was attempting to set up a call with Georgian Legislators to get them to call a special session. 
	He states in this email: 
		*"Professor Eastman told me tonight that it is critical that the 16 Electors for President Trump meet next Monday and vote in accordance with 3 U.S.C. § 7." In the e-mail,* 
		
	 (The statute (?) referenced is one describing the process unto which electors cast their votes.)
	 
	 Robert David Cheeley further states
		 *"I assume you can make sure this happen."*

- Giuliani retweets a petition for a Special Session to be held. Seems like they are getting desperate.
***

### Wisconsin's Scheme Begins

- Eastman emailed a Memorandum titled "*Real Deadline for Settling a State's Electoral Votes*". This was written by a Kenneth John Chesebro, advocating that Trump's Elector nominees in Wisconsin should meet and cast electoral votes for DJT. 
***

### TRUMP'S BIG BOO-BOO!!!!

- Trump commits the felony offense of

	*SOLICITATION OF VIOLATION OF OATH BY PUBLIC OFFICER, in Violation of O.C.G.A. §§ 16-4-7 & 16-10-1, in Fulton County, Georgia, by unlawfully soliciting, requesting, and importuning Speaker of the Georgia House of Representatives David Ralston, a public officer, to engage in conduct constituting the felony offense of Violation of Oath by Public Officer, O.C.G.A. § 1610-1, by calling a special session of the Georgia General Assembly for the purpose of unlawfully appointing presidential electors from Georgia

- (CHECK THSI!!)
	I believe up to this point, **Trump** has not directly solicited a Georgia official to hold the Special Session. **Giuliani** did, which is why he got the soliciting charge. He probably just *strongly* asked Speaker of the Georgia HOR, David Ralston to hold the Special Session. 

***
### (Extra) Does Giuliani not know that asking Georgian officials to do these things and perjuring himself is illegal?

- **Giuliani** asks MORE Georgian senators to commit
	 **The felony offense of SOLICITATION OF VIOLATION OF OATH BY PUBLIC OFFICER, in Violation of O.C.G.A. §§ 16-4-7 & 16-10-**
By asking a bunch of Georgian Senators to hold the Special Session. This happened in early December. ;

And PERJURS himself, making statements that were legally determined to be false. 

1. That it is quite clear from the State Farm Arena video from November 3, 2020, that Fulton County election workers were stealing votes and that Georgia officials were covering up a crime in plain sight; That at State Farm Arena on November 3, 2020, Democratic officials "got rid of all of the reporters, all the observers, anyone that couldn't be trusted," used the excuse of a watermain break, cleared out the voting area, and then "went about their dirty, crooked business";

2. That between 12,000 and 24,000 ballots were illegally counted by Fulton County election workers at State Farm Arena on November 3, 2020;

3. That in Michigan, there were 700,000 more ballots counted than were sent out to voters in the November 3, 2020, presidential election, which was accounted for by quadruple counting ballots;

4. That Ruby Freeman, Shaye Moss, and an unidentified man were "quite obviously surreptitiously passing around USB ports as if they're vials of heroin or cocaine" at State Farm Arena to be used to "infiltrate the crooked Dominion voting machines";

5. That 96,600 mail-in ballots were counted in the November 3, 2020, presidential election in Georgia, despite there being no record of those ballots having been returned to a county elections office

***


### The Coup begins. 

- Trump starts digging deep, finding loyalists with people like **Misty Hampton**, trying to get her to a hearing before the Georgia House of Representatives of Governmental Affairs Committee. 

- Kenneth John Chesebro writes a memo to a Trump lawyer, detailing their plan to institute their own electors in: Georgia, Arizona, Michigan, Nevada, PA, and Wisconsin.

- During this time, KJC contacts David James Shafer (Georgia Republican Party Chairman), asking his help in coordinating the false elector scheme in multiple states. 

- KJC then contacts David James Shafer (GA) and other Republican chairmen, sending them documents to be used for the false electors to cast their votes. 

- KJC sends an email to a Jim DeGraffenreid (Elector?), explaining 

	*"the purpose of having the electoral votes sent in to Congress is to provide the opportunity to debate the election irregularities in Congress, and to keep alive the possibility that the votes could be flipped to Trump."*

- KJC has a call with a Giuliani and a few others, stating that the media should not be notified of the Dec 14, 2020 meeting of presidential elector nominees in WI. 

- KJC emails Giuliani a "Privileged and Confidential" email, outlining strategies for disrupting and delaying Jan 6. KJC states the strategies outlined by him were "***preferable to allowing the Electoral Count Act to operate by its terms."***

- A day before the votes are to be cast, KJC writes an email quoting Giuliani, stating he "wants to keep the quiet until after all the voting is done", referencing the Dec 14 meeting of Trump presidential elector nominees in GA. 

***
# The Big Day. Dec 14th. 

- On the 14th, When there still has been NO Special Session held, Trump tweets: 
	*"What a fool Governor @BrianKempGA of Georgia is. Could have been so easy, but now we have to do it the hard way. Demand this clown call a Special Session and open up signature verification, NOW. Otherwise, could be a bad day for two GREAT Senators on January 5th."*

- David Shafer sends a message, stating
*"Listen. Tell them to go straight to Room 216 to avoid drawing attention to what we are doing,"*

- Then, David Shafer, Shawn Michael Tresher Still, and Cathleen Alston Latham committed 	 
	*The felony offense of IMPERSONATING A PUBLIC OFFICER, in violation of O.C.G.A. § 16-10-23, in Fulton County, Georgia, by unlawfully falsely holding themselves out as the duly elected and qualified presidential electors from the State of Georgia, public officers, with intent to mislead the President of the United States Senate, the Archivist of the United States, the Georgia Secretary of State, and the Chief Judge of the United States District Court for the Northern District of Georgia into believing that they actually were such officers by placing in the United States mail to said persons a document titled "CERTIFICATE OF THE VOTES OF THE 2020 ELECTORS FROM GEORGIA." This was an act of racketeering activity under O.C.G.A. § 16-14-3(5)(A)(xxiii)*

And
	*The felony offense of FILING FALSE DOCUMENTS, in violation of O.C.G.A. § 16-10-20.1(b)(1), in Fulton County, Georgia, by placing in the United States mail a document titled "CERTIFICATE OF THE VOTES OF THE 2020 ELECTORS FROM GEORGIA," addressed to Chief Judge, U.S. District Court, Northern District of Georgia, 2188 Richard D. Russell Federal Office Building and U.S. Courthouse, 75 Ted Turner Drive, SW, Atlanta, GA 30303, with intent to knowingly file, enter, and record said document in a court of the United States, having reason to know that said document contained the materially false statement, "WE, THE UNDERSIGNED, being the duly elected and qualified Electors for President and Vice President of the United States of America from the State of Georgia, do hereby certify the following." This was an act of racketeering activity under O.C.G.A. § 16-14-3 (5)(A)(xxii)*
And
	 *The felony offense of FORGERY IN THE FIRST DEGREE, in Violation of O.C.G.A. § 1691(b), in Fulton County, Georgia, by, with the intent to defraud, knowingly making a document titled "RE: Notice of Filling of Electoral College Vacancy," a writing other than a check, in such manner that the writing as made purports to have been made by the authority of the duly elected and qualified presidential electors from the State of Georgia, who did not give such authority, and uttered and delivered said document to the Archivist of the United States. This was an act of racketeering activity under O.C.G.A. § 16-14- 3(5)(A)(xvi)* (Cathleen Aston Latham)

- David James Shafer and Shawn Micah Tresher Still claimed to be the "Chairman of the 2020 Electoral College Meeting", and "Secretary of the 2020 Georgia Electoral College Meeting" respectively. 
*** 

### Mrs. Ruby Freeman 

- **Stephen Cliffgard Lee** attempted to commit
	*"The felony offense of INFLUENCING WITNESSES, in Violation of O.C.G.A. § 16- 10-93(b)(1)(A), in Fulton County, Georgia, by traveling to the home of Ruby Freeman, a Fulton County, Georgia, election worker, and speaking to her neighbor, with intent to knowingly engage in misleading conduct toward Ruby Freeman, by purporting to offer her help, and with intent to influence her testimony in an official proceeding in Fulton County, Georgia, concerning events at State Farm Arena in the November 3, 2020"*

- The next day, **Stephen Cliffgard Lee** attempted to commit
	*"The felony offense of INFLUENCING WITNESSES, in violation of O.C.G.A. § 16- 10-93(b)(1)(A), in Fulton County, Georgia, by traveling to the home of Ruby Freeman, a Fulton County, Georgia, election worker, and knocking on her door, with intent to knowingly engage in misleading conduct toward Ruby Freeman, by purporting to offer her help, and with intent t0 influence her testimony in an official proceeding in Fulton County, Georgia"*
- **SCL** then got some dude from Black Voices For Trump to talk to Ruby Freeman because SCL thought that didn't want to talk to her because he's white (???)
*** 

### What happens next? 

- The electorate scheme failed, but I'm not sure if **DJT** (or anybody for that matter), is fully aware.
- **DJT** calls a Georgia Chief Investigator stating that he won Georgia by "hundreds of thousands of votes"
- **DJT** calls AG and Deputy AG and tells them *"Just say that the election was corrupt, and leave the rest to me and the Republican congressmen."*
- **Jeffrey Bossert Clark** pressures high ranking DOJ officials to LIE to Georgia officials, stating that the DOJ 
	*"identified significant concerns that may have impacted the outcome of the election in multiple States, including the State of Georgia"*
