### What is the Senate? 

Each state has two senators who serve staggered terms of six years, making the Senate comprised of 100 members. They hold several powers of "advice and consent", which include the approval of treaties and nominations to certain positions, such as SCOTUS justices. 

The Senate Conducts trials of officials who have been impeached by the house. 

Due to the Senate having longer term lengths, smaller size, and statewide consistencies (House of Representatives are only responsible for their Congressional District), they are seen as less partisan. 

### How are Senators elected? 

The Elections Clause in the Constitution grants each state, and Congress themselves if they decide, the ability to determine how senators are elected. 

In most states, a primary election is held for Republicans and Democrats, with the general election following shortly afterwards. In most of these states, the nominee can win with just a plurality (more than everyone else, but less than a majority). In some states, however, a runoff (second election) is to be had if no majority to be had. 

There is a Senate election every two years, where a third of the Senate is up for re-election. Senators terms last for six years, and there is no limit for how many times they can be re-elected. 

### What does the Senate do? 

The Senate proposes, drafts, and amends bills, oversee the federal budget, decide whether to approve or reject presidential appointees, and make the final decision on impeachment trials.


### Presiding Officer

The VP serves as the president of the Senate, but their role is mostly ceremonious. They may vote in the Senate in the case of a tie, but they are not required to. They are also there to receive the tally of electoral ballots for the POTUS and VPOTUS, and count the electoral certificates in front of the Senate and HOR. 

When the Vice President is not in the Senate, the Senator of the majority party becomes the President Pro Tempore. They have all the powers of the VP (in regards to Congress), but they cannot break a tie. Their role is mainly 
	1. Calling on Senators to speak
	2. Ruling on points of order, or objections by senators that a rule has been breached
	3. Announcing the results of votes
